                            <p>I've taken a slightly different road to find out I like web development. I worked in manufacturing for most of my career, starting back in 2005 and just leaving the industry in December 2023. For many years, my job was to fabricate and weld parts that went onto airplanes and helicopters. When I decided to make a change I looked at what I wanted and if there was a path from where I was to where I wanted to go, and didn't see it, so I decided to change. I got a BS in Business and started the surprisingly difficult task pf pivoting. </p>

                        <div>
                            <h3 class = "section-heading">A little about where I am going...</h3>
                            In short, I am going to become a developer. Currently, that means going through the web development bootcamp on Udemy. Afterwards, I have learning paths for graphic design. My skillset will be one that can create artwork for sites and manage those sites effectively. I have a ton to learn, but that's what makes it fun.

                        <div>
                            <h3 class = "section-heading">The goal</h3>
                            <p>This is the driving force. Over the past year or so my partner and I started working on building a fantasy world. She plays a lot of Pathfinder, and we both have always loved fantasy novels. We started spitballing an idea and it got us excited to build and share it. She is the artsy one, and loves doodling and sketching beasties. I have always been more technically minded, and thought to build a site based around the world we were building. </p>
